# HR_data_Report
I prepared Power BI report with HR data analysis. It was a guided project based on YouTube video from channel [Her Data Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzyZI9uLXvY). SQL queries I did with support from the YouTube video. Power BI report I prepared by myself just by looking at the report in the video.
